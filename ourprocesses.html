        <p>
          Hushed was born out of the biggest problem in today's modern data storage tech – the immense wastage.
          Whether it's clouds, data centers or home servers, there is always an excess use of energy, money, and space.
          With the ever-growing market for data storage and the current state of the environment, there has never been
          a more crucial time to find a solution. That's why, at Hushed, we strive to change that.
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a home server that's not only compact and efficient but also built with state of the art, eco-friendly
          technology, a modular design, and an affordable price. That's Hushed. Sustainability is not just a feature for us,
          it's the core of our company. With factories in the deserts of Rajasthan and the flatbread deserts of Nevada,
          powered by wind and solar energy, Hushed is made from sustainable materials and is waste-free.
        </p>

        <p>
          A blend of I.T. and M.T technology – what's not to love about Hushed? We don't know either. Bringing you
          brighter storage. Smarter homes.
